                                I develop the Student Data Project just for fun. Currently a Computer Science student currently in my senior year. I take interest into front-end development especially 
                                everything about React and Vue. I love Javascript, JSX and the idea of Component reusability in React. 
                                I am currently learning concepts about bundlers and transpilers like Webpack and 
                                Babel, respectively. I would love to learn how to create REST servers using Node.js and Express.
